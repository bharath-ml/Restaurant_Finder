🍽️ Swiggy Restaurant Recommendation System

A machine learning-powered restaurant recommendation system that helps users discover restaurants based on their preferences using cosine similarity and interactive web interface.
🎯 Project Overview
This project builds a personalized restaurant recommendation system using Swiggy's restaurant data. Users can input their preferences (city, cuisine, rating, budget) and get tailored restaurant suggestions through an easy-to-use Streamlit web application.
✨ Key Features

🔍 Smart Filtering: Filter by city, cuisine, minimum rating, and maximum cost
🤖 ML-Powered Recommendations: Uses cosine similarity for accurate suggestions
🎨 Interactive Web UI: Clean, professional Streamlit interface
📊 Data Insights: Visual analytics of restaurant distribution and patterns
⚡ Fast Performance: Optimized similarity calculations for real-time results

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
pip package manager

Installation

Clone the repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/bharath-ml/Restaurant_recommendation_system.git
cd swiggy-recommendation-system

Create virtual environment (recommended)
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the data
bash# Place your swiggy.csv file in the data/ directory

# Run data preprocessing
python scripts/data_cleaning.py
python scripts/encoding_data.py


🔧 How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing

Cleaning: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, normalize data formats
Encoding: Apply One-Hot Encoding to categorical features (city, cuisine)
Feature Engineering: Convert multi-label cuisines to binary features

2. Recommendation Engine

User Input: Collect preferences (city, cuisines, rating, cost)
Similarity Calculation: Use cosine similarity to find matching restaurants
Filtering: Apply user constraints and rank results
Output: Return top-N restaurant recommendations

3. Web Interface

Interactive Controls: Sliders, dropdowns, and multi-select options
Real-time Results: Instant recommendations based on preference changes
Rich Display: Restaurant cards with ratings, cost, cuisine, and links

📈 Usage Examples
Basic Usage
pythonfrom recommendation_engine import recommend_restaurants

# Get recommendations
recommendations = recommend_restaurants(
    user_city="Mumbai",
    user_cuisines=["Indian", "Fast Food"],
    min_rating=4.0,
    max_cost=500,
    top_n=5
)

print(recommendations)
Web Interface

Select your city from the dropdown
Choose preferred cuisines (multiple selection allowed)
Set minimum rating using the slider
Set maximum budget using the cost slider
Click "Get Recommendations" to see results

📊 Sample Output
Recommended Restaurants:
┌─────────────────────────┬──────────┬────────┬───────┬─────────────────┐
│ Restaurant Name         │ City     │ Rating │ Cost  │ Cuisine         │
├─────────────────────────┼──────────┼────────┼───────┼─────────────────┤
│ Burger King             │ Mumbai   │ 4.2    │ ₹400  │ Fast Food       │
│ McDonald's              │ Mumbai   │ 4.1    │ ₹350  │ Fast Food       │
│ Domino's Pizza          │ Mumbai   │ 4.0    │ ₹450  │ Fast Food, Pizza│
└─────────────────────────┴──────────┴────────┴───────┴─────────────────┘
